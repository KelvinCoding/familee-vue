                  Johanna and Kelvin met while doing what they both
                  loved&mdash;dancing&mdash;in July 2017 at Arthur Murray dance studio in
                  Fort Worth, Texas. The two encountered each other in group
                  classes and social dance parties, but it wasn’t until their
                  mutual friend invited both of them to grab food and drinks
                  after a social party that the two had time to talk between
                  dance steps.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From there, they became unofficial dance partners and got to
                  know one another through deep discussions and frequent
                  texting. By September 1st, over some tacos from TacoHeads, the
                  two pragmatically admitted mutual feelings for each other and
                  Kelvin invited her as a +1 to a friend’s wedding that same
                  weekend.

                <p>
                  This was very much so an atypical relationship for 2017.
                  Things were not only straightforward but were approached with
                  clarity, respect, and above all else, efficiency. Whether
                  Johanna or Kelvin took a two week trip somewhere else in the
                  globe, they always maintained communications which only
                  further strengthened their bond. They’ve even gone on to enjoy
                  traveling together many places and can’t wait for more in the
                  future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Places they’ve traveled together:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Austin, Texas</li>
                  <li>Vancouver, Canada</li>
                  <li>Los Angeles, California</li>
                  <li>San Francisco, California</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Together the two have found the perfect partnership in all
                  things&mdash; dance, programming, and love.
                </p>

                  In late March of 2019, Kelvin scheduled a trip with some
                  friend and Johanna’s sister to Harry Potter World in
                  Hollywood, California. It was only appropriate to propose to a
                  girl who grew up with Harry Potter in front of the Hogsmeade
                  entrance. She said “of course”, and here we are now.
